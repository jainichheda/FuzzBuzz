                        <p>A Kashmir trip is full of excitement! Had heard a lot about Kashmir, but actually realized that this place is even more beautiful than that. Winter season, Gulmarg, Betab Valley, Shikara ride, houseboat stay.. just amazing. We had no idea that our festival would be celebrated in such a beautiful way in a place like Kashmir. Everything was unexpected. Everyone who came on the trip came together and enjoyed the festival. I felt very satisfied. Tour leaders managed such a large group very well. The joy of this first trip with FuzzBuzz will be remembered forever.</p>

                        <p>I had the pleasure of traveling with FuzzBuzz on the Rajasthan Mewad tour! Our tour leaders were very good and caring. They especially took care of my 8-year-old daughter very well. They attended to all the senior citizens of the group also. Our flight to Mumbai was rescheduled. They took great efforts to see that we were all very comfortable as we were 3 ladies traveling back. Looking forward to many memorable trips with you and FuzzBuzz Parivar!</p>

                        <p>I went for the first time to Kerala Kanyakumari with FuzzBuzz tours. Our experience was fantastic, the hotels were good, the coach was well-maintained and the food was delicious! Being a Jain I am very thankful to the tour leaders for providing me with Jain food at breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout 8 days tour. Tour leaders were polite, friendly, and very helpful. They were well-informed about the places we were visiting. I will recommend to all my Jain friends and relatives. I will surely travel again with FuzzBuzz tours!</p>

                        <p>We, the family group of 13 Senior citizens were allowed to trek by our kids only if we go with FuzzBuzz. We enjoyed Valley of flowers with Badrinath's dream trek because of the excellent guidance, support & kindness of team. We were pleasantly surprised by the support of two professional trekkers i.e. Durga & Amman besides Kesari's tour leaders. They have taken excellent care of the group all along the trek routes. This kind of support is FuzzBuzz's USP. Thanks again & best wishes for your future</p>
